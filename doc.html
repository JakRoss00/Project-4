            <p style="opacity:0.75;">This page will note all the goals, changes and outcomes of this site.</p>

            <section id="documentation">
                <p><strong>Overall Goal:</strong><br/> <br/>Creating an interactive learning experience to teach users about energy and where it comes from</p>

                <p><strong> Home Page:</strong><br/><br/>The home page consists of a simple navigation for the three interactive/illustrated pages and also includes an illustrated image of the logo for the site. This page conatins mainly html and css  </p>

                <p><strong>"What is Energy?" Page:</strong><br/><br/> This page will contain an image slider that will display illustration explaining what energy is and laws of energy. The slider is created using javascript, html and css referenced from W3School.com. The images used for the slider were altered in illustrator to contain the overlay explaining definitions and laws. In addition, the images had to be resized so that the page would load faster and run smoother.</p>

                <p><strong>"Where Does Energy Come From?" Page:</strong><br/><br/> The energy sources page consist of the image slideshow that dislpay illusatration and images of the different forms of energy. The slideshow is created be javascript, html and css referenced from w3schools.com. An issue i had at first was changing that text below the image, it took me a while to figure out but eventually i found that the javascritp was using the "alt" text for that specific section. After I figured that out it was a quick to added definitions and explainations.  </p>

                <p><strong>"Why is it Important?" Page:</strong><br/><br/> This page consist of html, css and and SVG vector image. The image shows a representation of our planet that was created in illustrator and exported as an SVG, along with a brief summary of why energy is important to us.</p>  
                
                <p><strong>Above and Beyond</strong><br/><br/> The above and beyond work that was done for this siite consistes of extensive research about energy in the world. In addition, I had to learn how to adapt images and assets to fit the sliders that were implemented on two of the interavtive pages. Many of the assests, the logo, definition images and the svg were created and/or altered via illustrator. The idea for the site started with the thought of allowing people to use websites as a form of interactive learning. This visual i wanted to orgininally implemented were not included becausei did not want to make the site too complicated for interactions. I chose to go with sliders and slideshows because it was similar to the idea of index cards or presentation to show information and give examples, allowing for an interactive study session.   </p>

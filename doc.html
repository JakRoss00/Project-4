                <p><strong>Overall Goal:</strong><br/> <br/>Creating an interactive learning experience to teach users about energy and where it comes from</p>

                <p><strong> Home Page:</strong><br/><br/>The home page consists of a simple navigation for the three interactive/illustrated pages and also includes an illustrated image of the logo for the site. This page conatins mainly html and css  </p>

                <p><strong>"What is Energy?" Page:</strong><br/><br/> This page will contain an image slider that will display illustration explaining what energy is and laws of energy. The slider is created using javascript, html and css referenced from W3School.com </p>

                <p><strong>"Where Does Energy Come From?" Page:</strong><br/><br/> The energy sources page consist of the image slideshow that dislpay illusatration and images of the different forms of energy. The slideshow is created be javascript, html and css referenced from w3schools.com </p>

                <p><strong>"Why is it Important?" Page:</strong><br/><br/> This page consist of html, css and and SVG vector image. The image shows a representation of our planet, along with a brief summary of why energy is important to us.</p>  
                
                <p><strong>Above and Beyond</strong><br/><br/> The above and beyond work that was done for this is consisted of the extensive research about energy in the world. In addition, I had to learn how to adapt images and assets to fit the sliders that were implemented on two of the interavtive pages. Many of the assest, the logo and definition images and the svg were created and/or altered via illustrator. The idea for the site started with the thought of allowing people to use websites as a form of interactive learning. </p>
